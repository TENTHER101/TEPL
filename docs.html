    <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome fellow programmers or soon to-be programmers! This guide is to
      explain thoroughly how TEPL works. TEPL is a basic programming language
      with many features to teach the basic concepts of programming. Beginners
      will find TEPL useful, but so will teachers for teaching kids in schools
      or in other places how to program. I hope you find TEPL useful. If you
      have any questions ask them
      <a href="https://github.com/TENTHER101/TEPL/discussions/categories/q-a"
        >here</a
      >. Now let's jump right in!
    </p>

    <h3 id="install">Installation</h3>
    <p>
      You only need to actually download the main.py and tepl.py files. In order
      to install all requirements run this command:
    </p>
    <pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre
    >
    <p>To start the program, run the main.py file. You should see this:</p>
    <img
      src="doc-images/tepl-docs-img-1.png"
      alt="Code Panel image"
      title="Code Panel"
    />
    <p>
      In this code line you can input the statement you'd like to execute. In
      the next lesson we will cover more details on how the code panel works and
      how to create our very first tepl file!
    </p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>When will TEPL be ready to use?</h3>
    <p>
      We will hopefully have it ready by the end of 2024 or possibly sooner.
      Currently, we're starting on building the base syntax. After we're done
      with that we will move on to more advanced functionalities and important
      features. Eventually, we will add libraries and frameworks.
    </p>

    <h3>Why use TEPL?</h3>
    <p>
      I know you are probably thinking, "And yet another programming language?"
      I understand that there are many, many(around 10,000) programming
      languages in the world today. So what makes TEPL(a new programming
      language) worth using? TEPL is built for beginners and is a backend
      development programming language. It contains no frontend features for
      now, but in the near future we will add VEPL(a library for TEPL, also
      known as: visually educational programming language) which will add some
      frontend development. TEPL is a great place to start if your new to
      programming because its grammar is like English. For example, in order to
      build a function you write:
    </p>
    <pre>
FUNCTION add a b MEANS
RETURN a+b
END 
</pre
    >
    <p>
      (Disclaimer: the syntax shown above is not yet available and may be
      changed, but the idea of functions is something we look to add later on)
      Simple, right? Yes it is! If you want to get a jump-start into programming
      TEPL is the choice for you.
    </p>

    <h3>License</h3>
    <p>
      TEPl was originally licensed under GNU, but for more security I set the
      license to the Apache license. In the end, I hope that this piece of
      software may inspire other projects and may improve the quality of new and
      existing software.
    </p>

    <h3>Credits</h3>
    <p>
      Credits to everyone(like literally everyone)! I got help from tons of
      different rescources and even from AI! I got inspired by those around me
      and by certain needs in our society. In the end of it all, I give credits
      to you(that's right even to you!) and to everyone else!
