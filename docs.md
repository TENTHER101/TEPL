### Introduction 
Welcome fellow programmers or soon to-be programmers! This
guide is to explain thoroughly how TEPL works. TEPL is a basic 
programming language with many features to teach the basic 
concepts of programming. Beginners will find TEPL useful, but 
so will teachers for teaching kids in schools or in other 
places how to program. I hope you find TEPL useful. If you 
have any questions ask them [here](https://github.com/TENTHER101/TEPL/discussions/categories/q-a). Now let's jump right in! 

### Installation 
You only need to actually download the main.py and tepl.py
files. You should have python 3 installed and ply. You can 
download python 3 on [python.org](https://www.python.org/). 
To download ply open the command prompt on your device and run
this command: 
```
pip install python
```
To start the program, run the main.py file. You should see 
this:

In this code line you can input the statement you'd like to
execute. In the next lesson we will cover more details on how
the code panel works and how to create our very first tepl 
file!

FAQ

## When will TEPL be ready to use?
We will hopefully have it ready by the end of 2024 or possibly 
sooner. Currently, we're starting on building the base syntax. 
After we're done with that we will move on to more advanced
functionalities and important features. Eventually, we will
add libraries and frameworks. 

## Why use TEPL?
I know you are probably thinking, "And yet another programming 
language?" I understand that there are many, many(around 
10,000) programming languages in the world today. So what 
makes TEPL(a new programming language) worth using? TEPL is 
built for beginners and is a backend development programming 
language. It contains no frontend features for now, but in the 
near future we will add VEPL(a library for TEPL, also known 
as: visually educational programming language) which will add 
some frontend development. TEPL is a great place to start if 
your new to programming because its grammar is like English. 
For example, in order to build a function you write:
```
FUNCTION add a b MEANS
RETURN a+b
END 
```
(Disclaimer: the syntax shown above is not yet available 
and may be changed, but the idea of functions is something we 
look to add later on) 
Simple, right? Yes it is! If you want to get a jump-start into
programming TEPL is the choice for you. 

## License
TEPl was originally licensed under GNU, but for more security 
I set the license to the Apache license. In the end, I hope 
that this piece of software may inspire other projects and may 
improve the quality of new and existing software.

## Credits
Credits to everyone(like literally everyone)! I got help from 
tons of different rescources and even from AI! I got inspired 
by those around me and by certain needs in our society. In the
end of it all, I give credits to you(that's right even to 
you!) and to everyone else!
